There will be a lantern parade coming up in the near future. 

Based on some advice in this reddit thread:

I ended up with this parts list:
Arduino Nano clone (ebay) - $4
USB power bank (banggood.com SKU084325) - $5.40
433 MHz transmitter/receiver pair (ebay) - $1
adafruit smart pixels http://www.adafruit.com/products/2226 - $6.00
